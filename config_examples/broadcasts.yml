# You can define broadcasts to run periodically here. 'Global' can be used to
# define broadcasts that are shown to all users online. There is an exception
# to this described below
# 
# 'Servers' can be used to define broadcasts that are per server. Within Servers
# the broadcast definitions are to be keyed by the server name. The definition
# for each server entry uses the same format as the Global entry, allowing for
# customization the Messages and Interval for each server
# 
# Broadcast Section format
# The format for broadcasts is as follows:
#  Interval: <time> # eg 5m
#  RandomStart: <true|false> # When true a random message is selected to be the first displayed
#  Isolated: <true|false> # When true, the messages defined in 'Global' will not be shown on this server.
#  Messages: [] # The messages to be shown. Remember you can use '| ' as a prefix to use multiple lines
# 
# 'Named' can be used to create named messages that can be broadcasted via command or automatically.
# The expected format is '<name>: <message>'. No extra features are present for named broadcasts
# To use these in automated broadcasts simply use '@<name>' as the message. You WILL need to quote it
# otherwise a parse error will occur
# 
# All messages support minecraft color codes using &
# After making changes, reload with command gsreload

# When true, automated broadcasts will be enabled. Manual broadcasts will always be available
Enabled: true
# The cooldown time for manual broadcasts with /!announce
ManualCooldown: 30s
# The global broadcast settings. NOTE: Isolated property will be ignored
